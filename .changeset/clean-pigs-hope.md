'@clerk/react-router': patch
---

Initial beta release of `@clerk/react-router`.

[React Router v7](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-v7) was released and Clerk's existing `@clerk/remix` SDK isn't compatible anymore. Thus the need for a brand new SDK came up. `@clerk/react-router` allows you to use React Router v7 + Clerk both in framework/library mode.

Visit [clerk.com/docs](https://clerk.com/docs) to read the React Router quickstart guide and further information in the reference documentation.
